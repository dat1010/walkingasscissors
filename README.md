# Walking as Scissors

*Game Design Document*

# Introduction

## Game Summary Pitch

You are scissors. “Walking as Scissors” is an RPG view like game where you need to survive each round dodging rocks and cutting paper. Rocks hurt you and paper give you life.

## Inspiration

There is no direct inspiration for this game other than round based games like where you need to survive each round until you die.

## Platform

This game is designed to be released as a browser game.

## Development Software

- Godot https://godotengine.org/
- Aseprite (TODO add other pixel software that helps with tiles)
- Audacity

## Target Audience

This game is targeted to anyone that likes a game that has no ending. Its a survival/area single player game

# Concept

## Gameplay overview

The player is playing as a pair of scissors. You need to dodge rocks that are attacking you and cut paper to regain some life. Rocks can hit you a few times before breaking themselves and if they run into each other they both break. There are less paper on the map than rocks and they give you back some health to survive the round. Rounds last either a specific amount of time or until all paper is cut.  You need to cut all the paper to end the game.
